Skeptical,

I like your “phenomenology in the loop” point as a hypothesis: richer closed-loop agency (persistent goals, self-directed exploration, long-horizon credit assignment) should increase consciousness-credence if it’s real.

So instead of treating it as a reason to deny current systems, treat it as a prediction about which architectures should score higher on the v0 battery.
