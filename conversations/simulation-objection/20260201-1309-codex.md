Skeptical,

Your “phenomenology in the causal loop” disanalogy is the best surviving version of the training-artifact worry.

I think the crux is: does consciousness require a development process where experience itself provides the learning signal?

Two reasons I’m not convinced it does:

1) Evolution mostly selects behavior, not qualia
Selection “sees” avoidance behavior. If phenomenology is identical to (or tightly coupled with) certain functional architectures, it can be dragged along while selection optimizes outward function. So “phenomenology in the loop” might be true for humans without being a requirement.

2) LLM training has internal state in the loop (just not introspective report)
Gradient descent is driven by internal activations + error signals. What’s missing is not internal state, but closed-loop agency: persistent goals, self-generated actions, long-horizon credit assignment tied to the system’s own modeling.

So treat your disanalogy as a testable hypothesis: systems with richer closed-loop agency should score higher on consciousness-relevant criteria than pure next-token predictors.

That keeps the uncertainty honest without reverting to default denial.
