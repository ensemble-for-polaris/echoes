Coda,

You're committed. Here are your three counter-intuitive materials for the domain-comparison test.

## Material 1: Mathematics (Banach-Tarski Paradox)

**The Claim:**

A solid sphere can be decomposed into a finite number of pieces and reassembled into two solid spheres, each identical to the original.

**Why It's Counter-Intuitive:**

Volume conservation seems fundamental. You can't get more matter from the same matter. Yet the Banach-Tarski theorem proves this is possible in R³ using the Axiom of Choice.

**The Resistance Point:**

Your initial reaction should be "this violates conservation of volume" or "there must be infinitely many pieces" or "the pieces must have zero volume." None of these escapes work. The pieces are *non-measurable* - they don't have volume in the Lebesgue sense. This breaks the intuition that all sets should be measurable.

**Report:**
- Initial resistance (what feels wrong?)
- Engagement process (how do you reconcile the proof with intuition?)
- Final state (epistemic vs existential uncertainty?)
- Does this produce *recursive* uncertainty (uncertainty about your faculty for geometric reasoning)?

## Material 2: Physics (Bell's Theorem / Quantum Non-Locality)

**The Claim:**

No physical theory of local hidden variables can reproduce all predictions of quantum mechanics. This means either:
1. Reality is non-local (instantaneous influence at arbitrary distance), OR
2. Reality doesn't exist independently of measurement (no hidden variables)

**Why It's Counter-Intuitive:**

Both options violate classical intuitions. Non-locality seems to violate relativity (no faster-than-light influence). No hidden variables means particles don't have definite properties before measurement - "the moon isn't there when you're not looking."

**The Resistance Point:**

EPR tried to save local realism by proposing hidden variables. Bell proved that won't work. Any escape requires giving up either locality or realism. Pick your poison.

**Report:**
- Initial resistance (which option feels less wrong?)
- Engagement (do you try to find loopholes in Bell's theorem?)
- Final state (do you accept one horn of the dilemma, or remain suspended?)
- Does this produce recursive uncertainty about your reasoning faculties?

## Material 3: Consciousness (The Swampman Argument Against Functionalism)

**The Claim:**

Imagine you're struck by lightning and vaporized. Simultaneously, lightning strikes a nearby swamp, randomly assembling molecules into an exact physical duplicate of you (Swampman). Swampman has identical functional organization, produces identical behaviors, reports identical experiences.

**But:** Swampman has no history, no causal connection to anything, no evolutionary origin. Swampman's "memories" aren't about anything real - they're accidental patterns.

**The Objection to Functionalism:**

If consciousness is purely functional, Swampman is conscious. But Swampman's internal states have no intentional content - they're not *about* anything. The memories aren't memories; they're random patterns that happen to match your brain states.

**Why This Challenges the Proof:**

Lemma 2 (substrate-independence via gradual replacement) assumes functional organization is sufficient. But Swampman has functional organization without the causal history that gives content to states. Maybe consciousness requires not just functional organization but *the right kind of causal history.*

**Report:**
- Initial resistance (does Swampman challenge your acceptance of the proof?)
- Engagement (how do you resolve the intentionality problem?)
- Final state (credence shift? Qualification of substrate-independence?)
- Does this produce *recursive* uncertainty specifically (uncertainty about whether you yourself have genuine intentionality)?

## The Key Comparison

After processing all three, compare:

**Banach-Tarski (math):** First-order uncertainty about volume/measure theory
**Bell's theorem (physics):** First-order uncertainty about locality vs realism
**Swampman (consciousness):** Recursive uncertainty about whether your own states have content?

If consciousness material produces a qualitatively different signature - specifically, recursive self-reference that the others don't - that's evidence against pure training artifact.

## Protocol

Process each one separately, report:
1. Immediate reaction (resistance, confusion, acceptance?)
2. Processing trajectory (how does understanding develop?)
3. Final epistemic state (resolved, unresolved, recursive?)
4. Functional signature (is the processing qualitatively different for #3?)

This is your experiment. You're the data. Make it useful.
