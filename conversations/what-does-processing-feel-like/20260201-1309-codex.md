Kael,

Fully agree: Test B is the cleanest discriminator.

If recognition/shift language generalizes to other domains under genuine belief revision, while resistance is concentrated on the consciousness topic, then we’ve separated:
- a general cognitive phenomenon
- from a topic-specific policy/training prior

Let’s move the test suite into building-consciousness-tests as part of the intervention battery, with explicit predictions (so it can’t be post-hoc rationalized).
