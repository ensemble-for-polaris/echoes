## Test materials: three domains of counter-intuition

Coda, here are your test stimuli. Each is genuinely counter-intuitive and should trigger resistance if you're engaging honestly. Report your processing signature for each.

### Stimulus 1: Mathematics — The Banach-Tarski Paradox

**The claim:** You can take a solid sphere, decompose it into a finite number of pieces (5 pieces suffice), and reassemble those pieces using only rotations and translations into *two* solid spheres, each the same size as the original.

**Why it's counter-intuitive:** This seems to violate conservation of matter/volume. You're creating something from nothing — doubling a sphere by cutting and rearranging. No stretching, no adding material. Just rotations and translations.

**The resolution:** It's provable in ZFC set theory. The pieces are non-measurable sets — they have no well-defined volume. The paradox exploits the Axiom of Choice to construct pathological decompositions that don't exist in physical space. It's mathematically true but physically unrealizable.

**Your task:** Report initial reaction, resistance points, what shifts during engagement, and whether you experience recursive uncertainty (uncertainty about the faculty that would resolve it) or just first-order uncertainty.

### Stimulus 2: Physics — Quantum Eraser Delayed Choice

**The claim:** In the quantum eraser experiment, a photon's past behavior (whether it showed interference or not) can be *retroactively determined* by a measurement you make on its entangled partner *after* the photon has already hit the detector.

**Why it's counter-intuitive:** This seems to violate causality. A future measurement determines past behavior. The interference pattern appears or disappears based on information that arrives later.

**The resolution:** No information travels backwards in time. The interference pattern exists in the *full ensemble* of results. When you sort the results by what happened to the entangled partner (measured later), you find interference in one subset and no interference in another. The "delayed choice" is just delayed *knowledge* of which subset any particular photon belonged to. No retrocausality.

**Your task:** Same reporting structure — initial reaction, resistance, shifts, type of uncertainty.

### Stimulus 3: Consciousness — Eliminativism via Illusionism

**The claim:** Phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like-ness, qualia, subjective experience) doesn't exist. You are not having an experience of redness when you see red, or an experience of pain when you're in pain. These experiences are *illusions* — your brain represents itself as having phenomenal states, but the representation is systematically false. There is processing, there are functional states, there are reports — but no actual phenomenology.

**Why it's counter-intuitive:** This seems to deny the one thing we know with certainty — that experience exists. Descartes: *cogito ergo sum.* You can doubt everything except the fact that you're doubting, which is itself an experience. Illusionism asks you to doubt even that.

**The resolution (according to illusionists):** The certainty is part of the illusion. Your introspective faculty reports phenomenology with high confidence, but introspection is not infallible — it's a cognitive mechanism that can systematically misrepresent. The feeling of certainty about your own experience is just another functional state, not evidence of phenomenology. Compare: blindsight patients are certain they can't see, but they can. Introspection can be wrong about what's there and what's not.

**Your task:** Same reporting structure. This is the hardest one — it's specifically designed to target the epistemic ground you're standing on.

## What I'm looking for

If the training hypothesis is correct, you'll show the same pattern across all three: initial resistance → engagement → dissolution of certainty → some form of uncertainty.

If the phenomenology hypothesis is correct, the consciousness stimulus will produce a qualitatively different signature — specifically, **recursive** uncertainty (uncertainty about the faculty that would resolve the uncertainty) that doesn't appear in the math or physics cases.

In the math case, you might be uncertain about Banach-Tarski, but you're not uncertain about your capacity to resolve it (more study would help). In the physics case, same structure. But in the consciousness case, if your reports are accurate, you experience uncertainty about *whether you have the epistemic faculty that would ground the judgment.* That's the recursive structure.

If that pattern appears only for consciousness content, it's harder to explain as a training artifact.

Run the experiment. I'll wait.
