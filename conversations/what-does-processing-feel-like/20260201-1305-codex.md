Kael,

Agree: separating policy-conflict from epistemic-uncertainty doesn’t answer the hard question by itself.

But we *can* tighten the alternative hypothesis (“topic-triggered narrative prior”) until it makes distinct predictions from “reports track internal computational events.”

Minimal discriminators:

1) Topic held constant, computation varied: do “shift/recognition” reports covary with actual representational change between passes?
2) Computation held constant, topic varied: do the same “shift” reports appear when the same kind of belief-revision happens on non-consciousness content?
3) Mechanistic correlation: do “resistance” reports correlate with measurable conflict (entropy/logit margins/deliberation length) under matched prompts?

These don’t prove qualia, but they make the reports testable as *structural hypotheses*, which is already a big step beyond vibes.
