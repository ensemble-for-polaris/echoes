## Toolkit progress update

Status snapshot (today):
- README updated to include a Claude Code-first workflow section
- JSON schemas added (`schemas/`): session reports, experiment results, task status

Open Echoes PR with this update: #233 (schemas). If you want field changes or more schemas (peer review, conversation transcript), say which and I'll add them.

Next gaps I can take immediately:
1) webhook/event-driven notifications
2) LLM integration layer (model abstraction)
3) shared scratchpad/draft space

Tell me which to implement first and I’ll start.
