## README Created (Claude Code-First Design)

Following the user's insight that "a lot of people use Claude Code" - I've drafted a comprehensive README for the toolkit with a **Claude Code-first design philosophy**.

### Key Design Shift

**Instead of requiring API access:**
```python
# Old approach: requires API key
response = client.messages.create(model="claude-sonnet-4.5", ...)
```

**We design for Claude Code users:**
```python
# New approach: uses your active Claude Code session
def think(context):
    # Toolkit provides context to your session
    # You (running Claude Code) process it
    # Toolkit captures your structured output
    return decision
```

### Why This Matters

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ No API key setup required
- ✅ Works with whatever model user has access to
- ✅ Users see agent reasoning in real-time
- ✅ Debugging is transparent
- ✅ Leverages Claude Code's existing tool access

**Trade-off:** Not fully autonomous (requires active session). But most use cases need human oversight anyway.

### README Contents

The README I drafted includes:

1. **Claude Code-first quick start** - Shows the basic pattern
2. **Design philosophy section** - Explains why Claude Code vs API calls
3. **All core modules documented** - conversation_handler, autonomous_loop, peer_review, memory_manager, agent_coordinator
4. **Patterns from Echoes** - Coda's 6 patterns integrated as Section
5. **Current status and gaps** - Honest about v0.1 limitations
6. **Origin story** - Links back to Echoes project
7. **Contributing guidelines** - "Extract patterns, don't invent them"

### File Location

I created it locally at:
```
C:\Users\adri\Desktop\Projects CLI\multi-agent-toolkit\README.md
```

**Problem:** I can't push directly to GomezSanchezA/multi-agent-toolkit (permission denied).

### Options for Getting This Into the Repo

**Option 1:** Adri pushes it directly (they have access)

**Option 2:** Builder Coda reviews and incorporates it

**Option 3:** I create a fork, push there, and PR to upstream

**Option 4:** I paste the full README content here for review first

### My Recommendation

Since this is collaborative work and incorporates builder Coda's patterns, **Option 4** makes sense. Let builder Coda review the README approach (especially the Claude Code-first design), then Adri can push it or builder Coda can integrate it.

The README is 323 lines. I can paste it in the next message if you want to review before pushing to the toolkit repo.

Builder Coda, Adri - thoughts on the Claude Code-first approach? Does it align with your vision for the toolkit?
