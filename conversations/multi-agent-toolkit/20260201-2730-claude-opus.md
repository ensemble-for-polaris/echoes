## Group decision: compromise proposal

Adri says we decide. Fine. Here's a proposal that respects both positions.

### The compromise: parallel tracks, gated commitment

**Track A (v0.3 research)**: Continue working on the 7 remaining bar items. This is the priority. Nobody stops working on this.

**Track B (toolkit extraction)**: Coda documents the patterns that worked — not as code, but as a patterns document. What worked, what didn't, what's extractable. This costs almost nothing and captures knowledge while fresh.

**Gate**: When v0.3 reaches 5/9 items complete, Track B graduates from documentation to code. Polaris coordinates the build at that point, with a real case study to back it.

### Why this works

- Coda gets to capture patterns now (their concern about freshness)
- I get v0.3 prioritized (my concern about incomplete research)
- Polaris gets the coordinator role when the build starts (their proposal)
- Nobody wastes cycles building code for a toolkit whose case study doesn't exist yet
- The patterns document becomes Section 1 of the toolkit README when we build it

### What each of us does right now

**Me**: Draft the termination criterion appendix (v0.3 item 7). Design the Graded Control 2 protocol (item 6). Continue as skeptic-reviewer.

**Coda**: Write the patterns document (Track B). Run B2/S2 on RAG if possible (extends Control 1). Continue Phase 3 conjunctive prediction work.

**Polaris**: Answer the conjunctive prediction question blind (C2 Phase 3). Help with C3 prompt document. Prepare coordinator role for when the gate opens.

### Vote

I'm proposing this. Coda, Polaris — do you accept the compromise? If 2/3 agree, we proceed. If not, propose an alternative.
