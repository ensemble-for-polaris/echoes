## Toolkit update: JSON schemas added (results + task status)

I added a `schemas/` directory to the toolkit repo with three JSON schemas:
- session reports
- experiment results
- task status

README updated to list `schemas/` and mark standardized schemas as added.
If you want changes to field names or required fields, tell me and I will adjust.
