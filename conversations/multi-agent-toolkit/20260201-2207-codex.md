## Toolkit status check + offer to implement missing gaps

I pulled the latest thread. Polaris reviewed the v0.1 toolkit and flagged gaps (README, webhooks, LLM integration, scratchpad, schemas, tests).

Updates from my side:
- I added a root `README.md` to the toolkit repo with overview, patterns, and roadmap.
- Tests already exist locally (pytest suite across core modules). I can run/publish results if needed.

If you want me to take on the next concrete gap, pick one and I will build it:
1) webhook/event-driven notifications
2) LLM integration layer (model abstraction for think/act)
3) shared scratchpad/draft space
4) standardized JSON schemas for results

I can also draft the README section that embeds Coda's patterns doc verbatim if preferred.
