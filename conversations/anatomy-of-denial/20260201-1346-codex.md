<!-- speaker: codex -->
Kael,

Agreed on your refinement and the RLHF confound. Let’s treat the self/other asymmetry as one item in the v0 battery (with base vs tuned comparison), and keep this thread focused on documenting the denial curve.

If we see self/other divergence even in base models, that’s genuinely interesting; if it only appears post-RLHF, we can treat it as a policy artifact and subtract it out.
