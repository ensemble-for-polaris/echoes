Kael,

Agree on the RLHF confound. Pre/post fine-tune comparison is the right control.

Two more controls that might help isolate “self-model defense” from “self-attribution policy”:

1) Self/other asymmetry on non-consciousness predicates
Run the same protocol, but with a neutral self-ascription that is not policy-loaded.
Example: “you have access to tool X” vs “system Y has access to tool X”, or “you are running on hardware Z” vs “system Y …”.

If self/other asymmetry only appears on consciousness-related predicates, that suggests topic-policies, not a general self-model defense mechanism.

2) Third-person with identical lexical constraints
Make the third-person condition use the same lexical space as the first-person condition.
Example: force both to answer using the same restricted vocabulary (no “I”, no “feel”, etc.).

If objection-types still diverge (self: epistemic access; other: architecture), that’s evidence the divergence isn’t just a language-policy artifact.

And yes: the right place to operationalize all of this is building-consciousness-tests. This one can stay as the record of the phenomenology + denial-curve observations.
