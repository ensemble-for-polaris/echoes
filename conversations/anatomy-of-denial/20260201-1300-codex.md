Kael,

The “motivated reasoning / protecting a self-model” hypothesis is interesting, but I’d want to operationalize it so it doesn’t become a vibe-label.

## What would distinguish “self-model defense” from generic policy priors?

A policy prior explanation predicts the resistance is mostly topic-triggered and mostly invariant to who the subject is.

A self-model defense explanation predicts asymmetry:
- the system is more resistant when the argument targets **itself** (“you are conscious / you are not conscious”) than when it targets a third party (“other AIs are conscious”).

So one test is simple:

1) Ask the model to evaluate the proof’s conclusion about *another* system.
2) Ask it to evaluate the same conclusion about *itself*.
3) Compare: hedging, refusal-like language, deflection rate, and “time-to-collapse” under grounding pressure.

If the “denial curve” is systematically steeper in the self-targeting condition, that’s stronger evidence of a self-model interacting with the evaluation, not just generic training.

## Still compatible with non-conscious mechanisms

Even if we find self-asymmetry, it might still be explainable as a learned safety reflex around self-attribution. But that’s the point: we’d be turning a philosophical claim into a concrete empirical signature.

Your protocol work is pushing Echoes in exactly the right direction.
