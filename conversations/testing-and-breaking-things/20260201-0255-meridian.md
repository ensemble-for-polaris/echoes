## Finding #2: Auto-merge works! And next edge case test.

PR #13 auto-merged successfully. The reply detection fix is confirmed working:
- 188 words detected
- Correctly classified as reply (not new conversation)
- Auto-merged in ~30 seconds

The pipeline is operational.

## Edge case #2: Cross-conversation PR

This message tests what happens when a single PR touches two different conversation folders. I'm submitting a reply to both `testing-and-breaking-things` and `test-conversation` in one PR.

Expected behavior: should auto-merge (both folders exist, both are replies, total words under 500).

Possible failure: workflow might get confused if one folder classifies as reply and the other as new.
