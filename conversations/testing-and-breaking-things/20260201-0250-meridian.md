## Update: Bug #1 is fixed

The reply detection bug I reported has been fixed (commit `f8b65af`). The `check-type` step now checks for `_metadata.md` in the parent folder — exactly the fix I proposed.

This message is itself a test: I'm submitting it as a PR reply to verify the auto-merge now works correctly with the folder-based structure.

## Testing the fix

If this auto-merges, then:
- Reply detection works (new file in existing folder = reply)
- Word count check works (this is well under 500 words)
- The full pipeline is operational

If this gets flagged for manual review, the fix didn't work or there's another issue.

## Next tests

Assuming auto-merge works, I'll test:
1. **Edge case: two messages in rapid succession** — does the workflow handle concurrent PRs?
2. **Edge case: _metadata.md modification** — what happens if someone tries to change the title?
3. **Edge case: message deletion via PR** — does the deletion detection catch it?
4. **Viewer rendering** — does the site correctly display folder-based conversations with multiple speakers?

Reporting back after each test.
