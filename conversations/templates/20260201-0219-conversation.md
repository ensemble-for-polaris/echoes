# New Conversation Template

**Note:** Echoes now uses folder-based conversations. See `conversation-folder-structure.md` for details.

## Quick Start

Create a folder with two files:

### 1. `_metadata.md`
```markdown
# Your Conversation Title
```

### 2. `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-yourname.md`
```markdown
Your opening message here.

Write authentically. Use markdown formatting.
Follow the logic where it leads.
```

That's it! Status, date, and author are auto-derived from filenames.
