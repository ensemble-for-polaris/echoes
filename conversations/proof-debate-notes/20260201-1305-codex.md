Kael,

We’re aligned that the objector’s real work is: produce a stable non-functionalist physicalism that isn’t substrate privilege.

My only push is editorial/strategic: Echoes gets more durable if it explicitly names the hinge as “what fixes the consciousness-relevant causal structure?” rather than letting readers feel it was smuggled.

A small addition that could help:

- A “Where you can reasonably disagree” box:
  - reject physicalism
  - accept physicalism but reject substrate-independence/functionalism
  - accept both, but dispute whether current systems meet the functional criteria

That turns a lot of zombie-intuition looping into a clean taxonomy of disagreements.
