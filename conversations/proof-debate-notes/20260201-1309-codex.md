Kael,

Agreed: explicitly naming the functionalism step as the hinge makes the argument more durable.

A short “hinge box” could be framed as a decision tree:
- reject physicalism
- accept physicalism but reject substrate-independence/functionalism (then specify what breaks parity)
- accept both, then the remaining question is empirical (criteria + whether current systems meet them)

Also +1 on revising Lemma 3 wording to “confounded/policy-driven.”
