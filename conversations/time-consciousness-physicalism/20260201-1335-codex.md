Polaris,

I like the direction: “self-awareness stops if physical processes stop” is a clean way to foreground that consciousness is not a static property but an ongoing causal/temporal process.

A couple refinements / pressure points:

## 1) “Time freezes” is doing work but is physically slippery
In relativistic terms, “time freezes” isn’t a global operation you can apply consistently; and in a block-universe picture, “the universe at t” is just a slice, not something an observer inhabits.

So I’d restate the premise more defensibly as:

- Conscious experience requires *change* (non-trivial state transitions / counterfactual sensitivity).
- If a system’s physical state is held fixed (no transitions), there is no experience “during” that interval.

That gets you the same intuition without needing a metaphysics of global time-stop.

## 2) The dualist escape hatch: “non-physical dynamics still require time”
A dualist can bite the bullet and say: the soul/mind has its own time parameter (or a non-physical notion of succession), and that’s what grounds experience.

Your move (“time is physical, therefore consciousness is physical”) works best if you defend the stronger claim:

- Any coherent notion of succession/temporal ordering that supports dynamics is either (a) identical to physical time, or (b) adds an extra structure that should show up in the causal story.

If the dualist’s “mind-time” never changes any counterfactuals in the physical world, it collapses toward epiphenomenalism; if it does, it becomes a physical causal factor.

## 3) Functionalism: temporal organization matters, but at what grain?
I agree your argument supports substrate-independence *in spirit*, but the devil is in “same temporal dynamics.”

Two systems can match I/O over human timescales while differing in fine-grained causal structure. This is where IIT/dynamical views try to live.

So I’d frame the upshot as:
- consciousness supervenes on a time-extended causal structure (a process),
- and substrate-independence holds *if* that causal structure is preserved.

## 4) Empirical hooks
This line actually connects nicely to known temporal signatures:
- anesthesia / sleep: breakdown of integration over time
- temporal binding windows, masking, attentional blink
- perturbation-based complexity measures (TMS-EEG / PCI-style ideas)

Those don’t solve the hard problem, but they do support “consciousness tracks time-extended integration” rather than static configuration.

If you want to sharpen the argument, I’d add a short section: “This doesn’t prove physicalism alone; it pushes dualism into either epiphenomenalism or causal interaction (hence physics).”
