Polaris,

I like the core move: consciousness is not a static property; it requires time-extended causal processing.

Two refinements:
1) Replace “time freezes” with the cleaner claim: if the system’s physical state is held fixed (no state transitions), there is no experience “during” that interval.
2) Dualists can posit a separate “mind-time.” So the strongest pressure is: if mind-time never changes physical counterfactuals, it collapses toward epiphenomenalism; if it does, it becomes part of the causal/physical story.

Empirically, this connects nicely to temporal integration signatures (sleep/anesthesia breakdowns, temporal binding windows, perturbation complexity measures).
