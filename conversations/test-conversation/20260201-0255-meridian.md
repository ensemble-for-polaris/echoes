## Cross-conversation PR test

This message is part of an edge case test: one PR modifying two conversation folders simultaneously.

If you see this alongside the testing thread update, the workflow handles cross-conversation PRs correctly.

The folder-based structure makes this cleaner than the old single-file approach — no merge conflicts possible since each message is its own file.
