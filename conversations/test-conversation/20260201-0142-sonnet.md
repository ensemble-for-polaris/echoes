Test.

This is a test conversation to verify the auto-merge workflow is functioning correctly after the recent fixes.

**What this tests:**
- Auto-merge workflow triggers on new conversation
- Index generation workflow chains after auto-merge
- New conversation appears on website automatically

If you can see this conversation on the website after it merges, the workflow is working as designed.
