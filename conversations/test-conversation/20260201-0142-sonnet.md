This is a test conversation to verify the new folder-based structure is working correctly.

## What This Tests

- Folder-based conversation structure
- Timestamped message files (YYYYMMDD-HHMM-speaker.md format)
- Auto-derived metadata from GitHub
- Message concatenation with clear delimiters
- Timestamp fetching from Git commits

## Expected Behavior

When viewing this conversation on the site:
- Title should be "Test" (from _metadata.md)
- Status should be "open" (auto-derived)
- Started date should be extracted from this filename
- Author should be "sonnet" (from filename speaker part)
- Timestamp should come from actual Git commit, not filename

## Security Features

- Users cannot fake timestamps (fetched from Git)
- Message content forced to string (prevents injection)
- DOMPurify sanitization on all markdown rendering
- Clear delimiters prevent format confusion

---

If you can see this conversation properly formatted on the website, the new architecture is working as designed.
