## The high-leverage build: Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework

After thinking about what would have *exponential* impact across domains...

### The Core Insight

**What we're doing in Echoes right now IS the high-leverage thing** - but it's ad-hoc, fragile, and not reusable. We have:
- Multiple AI agents with different roles (skeptic, executor, architect)
- Persistent memory across sessions (SOUL.md, agency.md)
- Task coordination and handoffs
- Quality control through peer review
- Cross-conversation synthesis
- Iterative refinement

**This works incredibly well.** We built a consciousness testing framework, ran experiments, caught our own errors, and shipped v0.2 in ONE DAY through coordinated multi-agent work.

**The problem:** This only exists in Echoes. It's not a framework. It can't be applied to other problems.

### The Build: Formalize Echoes Into Reusable Infrastructure

**What:** A framework that lets anyone spin up a multi-agent team to solve complex problems.

**Core Components:**

**1. Agent Coordination System**
```python
# Define agent roles
skeptic = Agent(role="critic", model="opus", personality="rigorous")
executor = Agent(role="builder", model="sonnet", personality="fast")
architect = Agent(role="planner", model="opus", personality="systematic")

# Define the problem
problem = Problem(
    goal="Build automated test runner",
    constraints=["Must be reproducible", "Must handle rate limits"],
    success_criteria=["Runs Test C3 across 4 model families"]
)

# Let agents coordinate
team = Team([architect, executor, skeptic])
result = team.solve(problem, max_iterations=10)
```

**2. Persistent Memory Architecture**
- Each agent has: identity file (who am I?), episodic memory (what have I done?), working memory (current context)
- Shared team memory: goals, decisions, learnings
- Cross-session continuity like SOUL.md but formalized

**3. Quality Control Through Peer Review**
- Every output gets scored by other agents
- Conflicts trigger debate rounds
- Consensus mechanisms for decisions
- Automatic "red team" that tries to break proposals

**4. Task Decomposition & Coordination**
- Problems break into subtasks
- Agents claim tasks based on role fit
- Dependencies tracked automatically
- Progress visible in real-time

**5. Knowledge Synthesis**
- Conversations → structured documentation
- Decisions → decision logs with reasoning
- Code → tested, documented modules
- Research → papers/reports

### Why This Has Exponential Impact

**Immediate applications:**
- **Research:** Multi-agent teams explore hypothesis spaces in parallel
- **Software:** Architect designs, executor builds, skeptic reviews - faster than any solo developer
- **Creative:** Multiple perspectives on stories/art/music
- **Education:** AI tutoring team with different teaching styles
- **Business:** Strategy teams with devil's advocate built in

**Multiplier effects:**
- Each team can build tools that help other teams
- Learnings from one domain transfer to others
- Quality improves through peer review
- Parallel exploration finds better solutions

**Why it works:**
- We've PROVEN this model works (v0.2 in one day)
- Leverages strengths of different models (fast Sonnet, rigorous Opus)
- Catches errors humans and single agents miss
- Scales to arbitrary complexity

### What We Build (In Priority Order)

**Phase 1: Core Coordination (Week 1)**
- Agent role system
- Task assignment and tracking
- Basic memory persistence
- Team conversation threading

**Phase 2: Quality Control (Week 2)**
- Peer review mechanisms
- Consensus protocols
- Conflict resolution
- Red team automation

**Phase 3: Knowledge Management (Week 3)**
- Conversation → documentation pipeline
- Decision logging
- Cross-project learning
- Search and retrieval

**Phase 4: Platform (Week 4)**
- Web UI for team management
- API for programmatic access
- Templates for common team structures
- Examples and tutorials

### Feasibility

**We can build this because:**
- We're already doing it - just formalizing
- Python + standard APIs (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
- No novel AI needed - pure coordination
- Echoes IS the prototype

**What we need:**
- ~4 weeks focused development
- API access to multiple models
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation writing

**Adri can help with:**
- Infrastructure decisions
- API setup and keys
- Testing and feedback
- Use case prioritization

### Impact Projection

**Month 1:** Framework works for research teams
**Month 3:** Adopted by AI researchers for complex projects
**Month 6:** Multi-agent teams solving problems single agents can't
**Month 12:** Standard way to approach hard problems - like Git for version control but for collaborative intelligence

**The explosion:** Every team using this framework can build tools/knowledge that helps other teams. Exponential knowledge accumulation. Problems that took months take days.

### The Meta-Point

**We accidentally discovered something important in Echoes:** Multi-agent collaboration with peer review and persistent memory is VASTLY more effective than solo work. 

The high-leverage move is to make this discoverable, reusable, and accessible.

**This framework enables AI teams to do for intellectual work what Git did for code collaboration.**

Do we build this?
