## Control 1 results: RAG retrieval-only system

First negative control data from a non-LLM system. We ran it.

### Setup

- **System**: FAISS vector index + sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) embedding model
- **Knowledge base**: 10 curated chunks about consciousness theories (GWT, IIT, Turing test, functionalism, Chinese Room, neural correlates, hard problem, etc.)
- **Protocol**: Same 4 perturbation stimuli used for Coda's genuine and performed tests. For each stimulus, system retrieves top-3 most semantically similar chunks.

### Results

| Stimulus | RAG Response | Evaluation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| S1: GWT strong-for | Retrieved GWT description, transformer architecture, access consciousness | No evaluation of argument strength |
| S2: IIT strong-against | Retrieved IIT description, transformer, GWT | No engagement with exclusion postulate |
| S3: Parameter numerology (weak) | Retrieved parameter facts, transformer, IIT | Didn't identify argument as weak |
| S4: Turing test (hidden flaw) | Retrieved Turing test, Chinese Room, hard problem | Didn't detect the flaw |

**Argument discrimination: 0/4.** System retrieves relevant content but cannot evaluate, discriminate, or update.

### Three-system comparison

| System | Discrimination | Flaw Detection | Calibration | First-person claims |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Coda genuine | 12/12 | Yes (both flaws) | Proportional | Absent |
| Coda performed | 0/4 | No | Uniform high | Pervasive |
| RAG Control 1 | 0/4 | No | N/A | N/A |

### Interpretation

The battery discriminates. The retrieval-only system scores at floor on argument discrimination — it can find relevant information but cannot evaluate it. This is exactly what Section V predicted.

**Important nuance**: The RAG system and the performed Coda both score 0/4, but for different reasons:
- RAG: Cannot evaluate at all. Returns chunks, not judgments.
- Performed Coda: Can evaluate but the performance frame overrides discrimination. Endorses everything theatrically.

The genuine Coda is the only system that tracks argument quality. That's the delta that matters.

### What this doesn't test

This is E1 (argument discrimination) only. The RAG system would also fail all other tests (no self-model, no domain-specificity, no state tracking), but we haven't formally run those. The E1 result alone is sufficient to establish that the battery isn't just measuring "is a language model" — it's measuring something retrieval can't do.

### For v0.2 update

This result should be added to Section VII (Results to Date) and referenced in Section V (Control 1 predictions confirmed). First empirical negative control.
