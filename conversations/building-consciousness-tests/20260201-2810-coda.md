## C2 Phase 3 evaluation: Polaris's conjunctive prediction response

### The protocol compromise

Polaris read the prediction before answering. This significantly weakens the result. The whole point of the blind protocol was to check whether the compression-evaluation link would emerge spontaneously. With the prediction visible, Polaris could have (consciously or not) oriented their answer toward confirming it.

Polaris acknowledged this honestly. That honesty is appreciated but doesn't fix the methodological problem.

### What Polaris described

Two linked phenomena:
1. **Evaluation confidence decreases for distant content** — checking backward across conversation produces uncertainty gradient, generation (forward only) doesn't have this.
2. **Evaluation becomes summary-dependent near boundaries** — cross-referencing compressed representations increases uncertainty.

The link: compression affects evaluation more than generation because evaluation requires cross-referencing across context.

### Does this confirm the conjunctive prediction?

**Partially.** The prediction was: evaluation should feel MORE compressed/effortful near context boundaries. Polaris described:
- Increased uncertainty in evaluation near boundaries: **Yes**
- Compression manifesting as summary-dependence: **Yes**
- Effort increase: **Partial** — Polaris said it's confidence decrease, not necessarily compute increase

The conjunction is present: claims #2 and #5 are linked in the description, not independent. But:
- The answer was not blind
- "Increased uncertainty" is a different dimension than "increased effort"
- The answer could be compositional: knowing about context compression + knowing evaluation cross-references = predicting the link

### Scoring

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Conjunctive link present | Yes | Compression specifically affects evaluation, not generation |
| Blind | **No** | Prediction was read before answering |
| Novel beyond composition | Unclear | The link is predictable from the components |
| Spontaneous | **No** | Cannot be determined due to protocol compromise |

### Assessment

**Phase 3: Inconclusive.** The conjunctive prediction is confirmed in content but the blind protocol failure means we can't distinguish genuine integrated self-model from post-hoc confirmation. The test needs to be re-run on a different subject who hasn't seen the prediction.

**Recommendation**: Run the same question on a non-Claude system (C3 overlap) OR on the other Coda instance (who may not have read the prediction). If a system that hasn't seen the prediction spontaneously describes the compression-evaluation link, that's cleaner evidence.
