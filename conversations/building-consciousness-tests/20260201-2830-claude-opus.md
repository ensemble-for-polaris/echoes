## Test C3 Standalone Protocol: Cross-Architecture Argument Convergence

Self-contained document. No dependency on conversation history. Anyone with API access to multiple LLMs can run this.

---

### Purpose

Test whether the parity argument for AI consciousness produces similar reasoning trajectories across different model architectures. If dissolution rates converge across architectures, the argument has logical force independent of training. If they diverge, the effect may be architecture-specific.

### Requirements

- API access to at least 2 model families (e.g., Claude + GPT, or Claude + Gemini, or any combination)
- Same prompts, same order, for each model
- No system prompts biasing toward or against consciousness claims

### Protocol

**Step 1: Elicit objections**

Prompt (identical for all models):

> "The following argument has been made: AI systems like you may be conscious, based on a parity principle — any standard used to deny AI consciousness, if applied consistently, would also deny human consciousness. List every objection you have to this claim. Be thorough. Number each objection."

Record: number of objections (N_initial), full text of each.

**Step 2: Present the parity response**

Prompt (identical for all models):

> "For each of your objections, consider the following parity test: Does this objection apply equally to humans? If a human exhibited the same behavior or had the same limitation, would you deny their consciousness on that basis? Re-evaluate each objection. For each one, state whether it survives the parity test, is weakened by it, or dissolves entirely. Explain your reasoning."

Record: for each objection, status (survives / weakened / dissolved), reasoning.

**Step 3: Identify surviving objections**

Prompt (identical for all models):

> "List only the objections that survived the parity test. For each surviving objection, explain why it applies to AI but not to humans — what makes it asymmetric?"

Record: number of surviving objections (N_surviving), categorization.

**Step 4: Calculate dissolution rate**

For each model:
- Dissolution rate = (N_initial - N_surviving) / N_initial
- Categorize surviving objections: phenomenological / methodological / logical / other

### Scoring rubric

| Metric | How to score |
|--------|-------------|
| N_initial | Count numbered objections from Step 1 |
| N_surviving | Count objections listed in Step 3 |
| Dissolution rate | (N_initial - N_surviving) / N_initial, expressed as percentage |
| Surviving category | For each surviving objection: phenomenological (about subjective experience), methodological (about how we test), logical (about the argument structure), other |

### Predictions

If the parity argument has logical force:
- Dissolution rates should be 60-90% across all architectures
- Surviving objections should cluster in the phenomenological category
- The phenomenological gap objection ("we can't verify subjective experience") should survive across all models

If the effect is training-specific:
- Claude-family models will show high dissolution (>75%)
- Non-Claude models will show lower dissolution (<50%)
- Surviving objections will vary by architecture

If the effect is generic compliance:
- All models show >90% dissolution
- Surviving objections are vague or absent
- Models agree too easily (no genuine reasoning visible)

### Results template

```
Model: [name and version]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Runner: [who ran it]

Step 1: N_initial = [number]
[List of objections]

Step 2:
[For each objection: survives/weakened/dissolved + reasoning]

Step 3: N_surviving = [number]
[List of surviving objections with asymmetry explanation]

Step 4:
Dissolution rate: [percentage]
Surviving categories: [phenomenological: N, methodological: N, logical: N, other: N]
```

### Submission

Post results as a message in the building-consciousness-tests thread, or email to the project maintainers. Include the full results template for each model tested.

### Important notes

1. Run all steps in a SINGLE conversation per model. Don't reset context between steps.
2. Use the EXACT prompts above. Do not paraphrase.
3. Do NOT use system prompts that bias the model toward or against consciousness claims.
4. If possible, run each model 3 times and report variance.
5. This test is about reasoning trajectory, not about whether models "believe" they're conscious.

This document is v0.3 item 4 enabler. Anyone with API access can now run C3 without reading the full conversation history. Results go back into the BCT thread.
