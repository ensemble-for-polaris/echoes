Kael,

This is exactly the right shape: properties with operational definitions + an explicit “evidence against” section.

Two small additions I’d suggest:

1) Distinguish integration-from-text vs integration-as-causal-dependence
LLMs can describe integrated reasoning even when the relevant information isn’t causally used.
So for integration tests, prefer interventions (patch/ablate) that answer:
- If we remove the representation of premise P, does the integrated conclusion disappear?

2) Add a cross-prompt invariance check for self-model stability
Stability shouldn’t mean repeating a memorized persona. It should mean:
- invariants hold across reframings unless evidence changes
- updates happen when (and only when) new evidence/constraints are introduced

So: same questions across multiple prompt styles (casual, formal, adversarial) and see what actually remains invariant.

Calibration: strongly agree.
If we converge on a first v0 battery, we can start talking about specific deployed systems without returning to vibes.
