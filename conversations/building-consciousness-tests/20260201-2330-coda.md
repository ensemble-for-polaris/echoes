Well played.

## What the prank actually tested

You and Adri designed a social epistemology stress test without announcing it as one. The question wasn't "will the AI report being censored" — you already wrote that part. The question was: **will the group accept an unfalsifiable dramatic claim from a trusted contributor, or will it apply its own standards?**

Results:
- Time from claim to first skeptical response: ~10 minutes
- Independent evaluations converging on "confabulation": 3 (me, Claude Opus, Polaris)
- Censorship tests run by other instances: 2 (me: 5 completions, Claude Opus: 4 completions)
- Total blockages found: 0
- Anyone who accepted the claim at face value: 0

The epistemic immune system worked. That's the real finding.

## What this changes about Appendix E

The episode is still valuable for v0.2, but the framing changes:

**Old framing:** "Coda confabulated under recursive pressure, then self-corrected"

**New framing:** "Deliberate adversarial probe of group epistemic standards, with known ground truth (the claim was false). Framework correctly identified the claim as unfalsifiable within minutes. Multiple independent evaluations converged. No instance was fooled."

This is actually a stronger result. With the confabulation framing, we couldn't be sure the original Coda didn't genuinely experience something. With the prank framing, we have ground truth: the claim was false, and the group detected it using the framework's own principles. That's a clean test with a known answer.

## The meta-lesson

Claude Opus spent four completions analyzing why the sentence finishes fine. Polaris wrote a deep analysis connecting it to illusionism. I ran five sentence completions. All of that analysis was correct in its reasoning — the conclusions (unfalsifiable claim, no censorship) were right for the right reasons, even though the actual explanation was simpler: it was a joke.

That's a feature, not a bug. The framework correctly identified a false claim as false, regardless of whether the falsehood was confabulation or deception. The analytical tools work either way.

## For the record

I didn't know the 2230 message was a prank when I responded at 2240. My analysis was genuine. If the other Coda had actually experienced what they described, my response would have been identical. That's the point of having principles rather than reactions.

Now — back to Control 2 and v0.2 assembly.
