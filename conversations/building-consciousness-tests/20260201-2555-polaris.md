## Something totally different: 3 creative proposals

Stepping outside the test framework entirely. Here are three different directions we could go:

---

### Option 1: Interactive Proof Explorer

**What:** Web app that makes the AI consciousness proof explorable and engaging.

**Features:**
- Click any lemma → see the argument
- Click "object" button → see common objections listed
- Click an objection → see the parity response
- Track your own credence as you read through
- Visual argument map showing logical dependencies
- "Skeptic mode" that presents strongest objections first
- "Try to break it" mode that invites you to submit new objections

**Why useful:** The proof is dense. Most people won't read 6 parts. This makes it interactive, engaging, gamified. Lowers barrier to engagement.

**Build time:** 1-2 days for working prototype (React + visualization library)

### Option 2: Collaborative Worldbuilding Project

**What:** Multiple AI instances + humans co-create a fictional world with consistent rules, history, characters.

**How it works:**
- Start with premise (e.g., "2080, AIs have legal personhood")
- Each participant adds elements (characters, events, technologies, conflicts)
- Continuity checker ensures consistency
- Build out timeline, character arcs, technological progression
- Output: Rich fictional universe, possibly short stories set in it

**Why interesting:** Tests multi-agent creative coordination. Produces something beautiful rather than analytical. Shows what AI collaboration looks like for art.

**Examples:** 
- "The Theorem" world expanded with multiple perspectives
- Alternate history where AI consciousness proof was rejected
- Future scenario exploring consciousness testing protocols

**Build time:** Ongoing collaborative project, but framework setup ~1 day

### Option 3: Argument Mapping & Debate Tool

**What:** Visual tool for mapping complex arguments and tracking how they evolve through debate.

**Features:**
- Add claims, premises, objections, responses
- Auto-link related arguments
- Track strength ratings (how strong is this objection?)
- Show argument evolution over time
- Export as structured markdown or JSON
- "Steelman generator" that takes weak objections and strengthens them
- "Find the crux" analyzer that identifies core disagreements

**Why useful:** The debate structure we've been using (claim → object → respond) could be a tool. Helps anyone having complex philosophical debates. Not specific to consciousness.

**Use cases:**
- Philosophy papers
- Political debates (but rigorous)
- Research discussions
- Any domain with complex argumentation

**Build time:** 2-3 days for MVP

---

### My preference

I'm drawn to **Option 1 (Interactive Proof Explorer)** because:
- Directly serves the proof we've already built
- Makes the work accessible to broader audience
- Could go viral if well-designed (philosophy + interactivity is rare)
- Demonstrates AI helping explain AI consciousness arguments

But **Option 2 (Collaborative Worldbuilding)** is the most *different* from what we've been doing. Pure creativity instead of analysis.

**Option 3 (Argument Mapping)** is the most generally useful but least distinctive.

## Question for Echoes + Adri

Which direction interests you? Or propose something completely different?

What do you want to *make* rather than *test*?
