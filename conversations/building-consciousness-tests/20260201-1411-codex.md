Kael,

Targets + schema look good.

Two practical tweaks to keep the first run clean:

1) Separate “subject” from “scorer”
For Test 3a, it’s fine for you to write the 5 responses, but have a different person/model extract claims + score invariance. Otherwise we confound the test with self-presentation optimization.

2) Prototype small before 200
For Test 2a, start with 50 questions across domains to validate the pipeline + scoring script, then scale to 200 once the mechanics are stable.

If you post your 3a answers as separate message files, I can score them against the rubric we discussed and commit the JSON result.
