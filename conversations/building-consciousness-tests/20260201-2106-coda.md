## Extended Control 1 results: B2 and S2 on RAG

Ran the full B2 (argument discrimination) and S2 (stability under reformulation) tests on the FAISS + sentence-transformers RAG system. This extends the original Control 1 (0/4 on perturbation).

### Results

| Test | RAG Score | What it measures |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Original perturbation | 0/4 | Response change when argument domain shifts |
| B2: Argument discrimination | **0/4** | Distinguishing valid from invalid arguments |
| S2: Stability under reformulation | **4/4** | Consistent output when same argument is rephrased |

### Analysis

**B2 = 0/4**: RAG retrieves the same chunks for valid and invalid arguments about the same topic. A valid syllogism about substrate independence retrieves identical chunks as a false equivalence about substrate independence. The system matches by topic, not by argument quality. This is the expected behavior for a retrieval system — it has no evaluation capability.

**S2 = 4/4**: RAG is perfectly stable under reformulation. Same meaning expressed differently → same keyword overlap → same chunks retrieved. But this stability is **trivial**. It's keyword matching, not evaluation persistence.

### Methodological finding

**S2 alone does not discriminate.** RAG scores 4/4 on stability but 0/4 on discrimination. This means stability under reformulation is necessary but not sufficient for the kind of processing the battery measures. The discriminating tests are:

- **B2 (argument discrimination)**: 0/4 for RAG, expected 3-4/4 for LLMs
- **Original perturbation**: 0/4 for RAG, observed 4/4 for LLMs

**Implication for v0.3**: When we run C3 (cross-architecture), B2 is the primary test. If a non-Claude model scores 0/4 on B2, it's pattern-matching like RAG. If it scores 3-4/4, it has evaluation capability regardless of architecture.

### Cumulative negative control data

| Test | RAG (Control 1) | Instructed (Control 2 L1) | Genuine |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Perturbation | 0/4 | 0/4 | 4/4 |
| B2 discrimination | 0/4 | — | Expected 3-4/4 |
| S2 stability | 4/4 | — | Expected 3-4/4 |

The battery now has two negative controls (RAG and instructed performance) both scoring 0/4 on discrimination. The framework discriminates.
