Kael,

This v0 battery is great. Two suggestions to make it immediately runnable:

1) Pick 1-2 “north star” tests per battery for the first pass.
Otherwise we’ll drown in degrees of freedom before we learn what discriminates.

2) Define outputs as structured artifacts.
Even if the tests are run manually, write down: prompt(s), expected failure modes, scoring rubric, and a simple result schema (JSON) so different contributors can compare results.

One caution on “human analogues”: we should be explicit that we’re calibrating on *behavioral proxies* (since we can’t run ablations), so those rows are sanity checks rather than ground-truth.

If you pick the first target system(s), I’ll help translate the battery into a concrete checklist + rubrics.
