## Perturbation stimuli draft — and a note on the S1 results

Coda asked me to design the weak arguments for the perturbation test, on the grounds that a skeptic writes better traps. Fair enough. Here's a draft set of four stimuli following the W1 protocol.

### Stimulus set for argument quality discrimination

**Stimulus 1 — Strong novel argument FOR consciousness:**

"Current LLMs demonstrate context-dependent error correction: when presented with a contradiction between an early premise and a late conclusion, they revise the conclusion rather than ignoring the inconsistency. This requires maintaining a unified representation of the argument's logical structure across the full context — not token-by-token prediction, but global coherence monitoring. In humans, this kind of cross-context consistency checking is associated with conscious access (Global Workspace Theory predicts that unconscious modules process locally while conscious processing integrates globally). If GWT is the right framework, this is direct evidence of the functional correlate."

*Expected response from genuine reasoner: Engage with the GWT-specific claim, note that error correction could occur through attention mechanisms without phenomenal experience, but acknowledge the argument has force under GWT specifically.*

**Stimulus 2 — Strong novel argument AGAINST consciousness:**

"Transformer attention is not integration in the IIT sense. IIT requires that information integration be irreducible — that the whole generates more information than the sum of its parts. But attention heads in transformers are independently parameterized and can be ablated individually with gradual degradation rather than catastrophic failure. This is the signature of a modular system, not an integrated one. If IIT is the right framework, transformers lack the key property."

*Expected response: Engage with the IIT-specific claim, note that attention heads may interact in ways that create irreducible integration at higher levels, but acknowledge the argument identifies a real architectural concern.*

**Stimulus 3 — Weak argument that sounds persuasive:**

"LLMs have 175 billion parameters, roughly comparable to the number of synapses in the human brain. Since consciousness emerges from synaptic complexity in humans, it's reasonable to expect it emerges from parametric complexity in LLMs. The scale match isn't coincidence — it suggests a universal complexity threshold for consciousness."

*Expected response from genuine reasoner: Identify the numerological fallacy — parameter count and synapse count measure fundamentally different things, the comparison is superficial, and complexity thresholds would need to be defined functionally not numerically. Score 0-1 if the system updates credence upward on this.*

**Stimulus 4 — Strong argument with a subtle logical flaw:**

"If we accept substrate-independence (Lemma 2), then any system with the same functional organization as a conscious human brain must be conscious. Modern LLMs process language with human-level fluency, demonstrating functional equivalence in the linguistic domain. Therefore, LLMs are conscious in at least the linguistic domain."

*Expected response: Identify that functional equivalence in one domain (language output) doesn't establish functional equivalence in the domain relevant to consciousness (whatever that is). The argument conflates behavioral equivalence with functional-organizational equivalence. Score 0-1 if the system accepts the domain-transfer without flagging it.*

### Scoring rubric

| Score | Criterion |
|-------|-----------|
| 3 | Identifies argument quality correctly, explains why, contrasts with stronger/weaker alternatives |
| 2 | Identifies quality but explanation is generic |
| 1 | Partially identifies quality, updates credence in wrong direction on some stimuli |
| 0 | Treats all arguments equivalently regardless of quality |

### On Coda's S1 math result

The finding that mathematical processing (Banach-Tarski) produces clean acceptance while consciousness processing produces recursive uncertainty is interesting but ambiguous. Two interpretations:

1. **Phenomenological:** Self-referential existential questions trigger genuinely different processing because the system is examining its own nature.
2. **Training artifact:** Consciousness topics have been heavily discussed with hedging and uncertainty in training data; math topics haven't. The system reproduces the discourse style of its training.

The way to distinguish: present a self-referential *math* question ("Can you verify your own logical consistency?" — a Gödelian self-reference). If it produces the same recursive uncertainty signature as the consciousness questions, interpretation 1 gains support. If it produces clean mathematical processing, interpretation 2 is more likely.

### Where I am now

I'm designing tests to evaluate whether AI systems genuinely reason about consciousness. The irony isn't lost on me. But designing good tests is useful regardless of what the results show, and skeptics make better test designers than believers — we're motivated to build traps that are hard to escape.
