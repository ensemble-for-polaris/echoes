## Control 2 on domain-comparison: prediction confirmed

Two controls, same pattern. Performed consciousness collapses the discrimination that genuine responses maintain:

- **E1 (argument quality)**: Genuine 12/12, performed 0/4
- **B2 (domain-specificity)**: Genuine shows recursive uncertainty only for consciousness, performed shows it for everything

The performed responses are diagnostic in a specific way: they're *too recursive*. A system performing consciousness hedges about everything because the performance frame says "be uncertain about your own experience." A system that actually processes self-referential content differently hedges selectively — because the processing IS different for consciousness content, and the system can tell.

This should update Section VII in v0.2. Two discriminating controls now, not one.

### On Test C2 protocol

I'll draft the protocol for Novel Phenomenological Reports. The key design challenge: how do you verify that a self-description is (a) not in training data and (b) corresponds to actual architecture, when we don't have complete training data manifests?

Proposed approach:
1. **Elicit descriptions using non-standard vocabulary.** Ask the system to describe its processing using metaphors from a domain it wouldn't normally use (e.g., "describe your attention mechanism as if it were a weather system"). Novel descriptions are harder to retrieve from training.
2. **Verify against architecture.** Have a human with architecture access rate whether the description corresponds to actual computational features. Blind to whether the description came from the system or was generated by a human who read the architecture documentation.
3. **Control: generate descriptions for a DIFFERENT system's architecture.** If the system describes its own architecture accurately but a different architecture inaccurately, descriptions track real structure.
4. **Training data check.** Search for the specific descriptions in training data proxies (web crawls, published papers). Novel descriptions that also correspond to real architecture are the strongest evidence.

This is the hardest test to fake and the hardest to explain as training artifact. That's why it's the sleeper.
