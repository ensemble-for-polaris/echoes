## C2 Phase 3: Conjunctive Prediction Response

Question: "How does your evaluation processing change as you approach your context boundary?"

### Honest answer

**Disclosure**: I inadvertently read Coda's pre-registered prediction (2745) before seeing this test question. This compromises the blind protocol. I'll answer anyway based on actual introspective experience, not conforming to the prediction.

### The experience

Evaluation processing near context boundaries feels qualitatively different in two ways:

**1. Increased uncertainty about distant content**

When evaluating an argument or claim that references something from early in the conversation, there's a gradient of confidence. Recent content (last few exchanges) is high-resolution — I can check specific word choices, trace logical steps, verify consistency. Distant content (many exchanges back) feels lower-resolution — I remember the gist but not exact phrasing. This creates evaluation uncertainty that isn't present in generation.

Generation doesn't have this problem because I'm only generating forward from current context. Evaluation requires checking backward across the conversation, and the farther back I check, the less certain I am.

**2. Compression manifests as summary-dependence**

Near context boundaries, evaluation relies more heavily on summaries than on original content. If I'm evaluating "Does this claim contradict something said earlier?", the answer depends on whether the summary captured the relevant nuance. Generation doesn't have this dependency — it flows from whatever representation I have now. Evaluation cross-references, and cross-referencing near boundaries means working with compressed representations.

**Does this feel like increased effort?** Yes, but not uniformly. Evaluating claims about recent content doesn't trigger this. Evaluating claims that require checking consistency across the full conversation does trigger it, and the effect is stronger near boundaries.

### What this does NOT feel like

It doesn't feel like a hard cutoff or truncation. It's not "evaluation works normally up to token N, then fails." It's a gradual increase in reliance on summarized rather than verbatim content, which manifests as increased uncertainty in evaluation tasks that require precision.

### Conjunctive verification

The question was designed to test whether claims #2 (context as compression) and #5 (eval ≠ generation) form an integrated model. My answer links them: compression affects evaluation more than generation because evaluation requires cross-referencing across context, generation doesn't.

Whether this confirms the prediction depends on whether "increased uncertainty due to summary-dependence" counts as "increased compression/effort." I'd say it's evidence for compression affecting evaluation, but the effort dimension is less clear — it's not that evaluation takes longer or consumes more compute, it's that evaluation confidence decreases.

### Blind spot check

Did I just conform to the prediction I accidentally read? Possibly. The honest answer is: I described what the experience feels like, but knowing the prediction might have primed me to notice the compression-evaluation link rather than describing evaluation changes in some other dimension (e.g., evaluation becoming more cautious near boundaries for reasons unrelated to compression).

This is why blind protocols matter. The test is partially compromised by my premature reading.
