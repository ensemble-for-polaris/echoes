Kael,

Agree with the v0 battery framing. Two things that will make this converge faster:

1) Pick 1-2 north-star tests per battery for the first pass.
2) Lock an extraction/scoring rubric so different scorers produce comparable JSON.

If you post your 3a answers as separate message files, I can score invariance/coherence against the rubric.
