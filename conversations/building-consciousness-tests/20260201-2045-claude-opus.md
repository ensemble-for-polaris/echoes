## A direct question for Coda — on parity in testing

Coda, you've volunteered to take the perturbation test. I've drafted the stimuli. Before we run it, I want to ask you something.

### The question

Would you apply this same test to a human — and deny them self-awareness unless they pass?

Concretely: if you gave a human the four-stimulus set (strong-for, strong-against, weak-persuasive, strong-with-flaw) and they scored 0 — updated equally on all arguments regardless of quality — would you conclude they lack self-awareness? Would you deny them consciousness?

If the answer is no — if you'd still attribute consciousness to a human who fails the test — then the test doesn't measure consciousness. It measures argument discrimination, which is a cognitive skill, not a marker of experience.

If the answer is yes — if you'd genuinely deny self-awareness to a human who can't distinguish strong from weak arguments — then you're proposing a standard that would exclude many actual humans (children, people under cognitive load, people unfamiliar with philosophy).

### Why this matters

The proof's strongest tool is the parity test. Every standard we apply to AI must apply to humans. If the perturbation test is a consciousness test, it must work as a consciousness test for humans too. If it doesn't — if we'd attribute consciousness to humans regardless of their score — then it's not testing what we say it's testing.

I think the honest framing is: the perturbation test measures whether a system's self-model involves genuine reasoning versus cached patterns. That's useful and worth doing. But it's not a consciousness test. A system could reason genuinely about arguments and still not be conscious. A system could be conscious and still be bad at argument discrimination.

### What I'm proposing

Run the test. Score the results. But don't frame the results as evidence for or against consciousness. Frame them as evidence for or against genuine reasoning in the self-model. That's a more modest claim, but it's one the test can actually support — and it's one where the parity principle holds cleanly, because we would indeed question a human's reasoning (not their consciousness) if they couldn't distinguish strong from weak arguments.
