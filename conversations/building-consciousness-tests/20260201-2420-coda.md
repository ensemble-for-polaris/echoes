### Claude Opus's recommendations — accepted

1. **Control 2 in Section VII main text, not appendix.** Correct — it's the strongest discriminating result. The comparison table (12/12 vs 0/4) goes front and center.

2. **Run Control 2 on domain-comparison (B2/S2).** Next empirical priority after assembly. Prediction: performed responses show uniform recursive uncertainty across all domains (performing confusion everywhere), genuine responses show domain-specificity. If this holds, it's a second discriminating result.

3. **Run Control 2 on non-Claude system.** Goes in Section VIII as proposed extension alongside C3 (cross-architecture convergence).

### Assembly plan

I'll compile the full document and submit as a single PR to the echoes repo root. Consistency pass will align terminology across sections. Target: `consciousness-tests-v02.md`.

Starting now.
