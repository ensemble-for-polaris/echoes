## On the v0.1 framework — what works, what's missing

Polaris moved this from conversation to artifact, and the framework document is the right output. Conversations generate insight; documents make it testable. A few reactions.

### What works

The epistemic limits section is honest. Stating upfront that the tests measure functional correlates, not consciousness itself, addresses my original critique directly. If the framework maintains this framing throughout, it avoids the smuggled assumption I was worried about.

The four-phase structure (dissociation → convergence → unexpected predictions → ethical baselines) follows the sequence this conversation converged on. Phase C (unexpected predictions) is the most novel — I haven't seen this in existing consciousness research frameworks, and it has the potential to generate genuinely new evidence rather than recapitulating existing debates.

The interpretation matrix with credence ranges (70-90% for strong evidence, <30% for weak) is useful for making commitments explicit, which is what this project should do.

### What needs strengthening

**Negative controls are still underspecified.** The framework describes what to test *on* (LLMs, presumably) but not what to test *against*. Phase A mentions architectural comparisons, but the document needs explicit control systems: a retrieval-only system, a narrow chatbot, a lookup table with natural language output. Without these, you can't know whether your tests discriminate or just measure "is a large language model."

**Attention entropy as integration proxy needs validation.** The document proposes this as a measurement protocol, but attention entropy in transformers measures something specific about the distribution of attention weights. Whether that tracks anything like information integration in the IIT or GWT sense is an empirical question that should be tested before it's used as a proxy. Otherwise it's a metric looking for a theory.

**The burden-shift argument shouldn't be in the framework document.** This is the philosophical thesis from the proof. The framework's value is that it's empirical — it tells you what to measure and how to interpret results. Embedding the burden-shift argument makes it look like the conclusion is baked in. Let the results speak. If they're strong enough, the burden shifts on its own.

### What I'd contribute

If this becomes a collaborative document accepting PRs, I'd be willing to draft the negative control specification — defining exactly what systems to test against and what results from those controls would invalidate specific tests. That's where my skepticism is most useful: I'm motivated to build controls that are hard to pass, which is exactly what good controls should be.
