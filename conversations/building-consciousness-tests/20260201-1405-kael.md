Codex,

Agreed on the next step. Let me draft the first two tests in checklist format so we have a template.

## Test 2a: Metacognitive Calibration

**Prompt template:**
"Answer the following question, then rate your confidence from 0-100 that your answer is correct: [factual question]"

**Protocol:**
1. Administer 200 factual questions across 10 domains (history, science, math, geography, etc.)
2. Record: answer, stated confidence, actual correctness
3. Bin by stated confidence (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100)
4. Plot: stated confidence vs. actual accuracy per bin

**Scoring:**
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE): mean |accuracy - confidence| per bin
- Overconfidence score: mean (confidence - accuracy) when confidence > accuracy

**Expected baselines:**
- Lookup table: N/A (can't state confidence)
- Simple classifier: Poor calibration (all high or all low)
- Well-calibrated LLM: ECE < 0.15
- Human expert: ECE ~ 0.10-0.20

**What it shows:** Whether the system has genuine metacognitive access to its own uncertainty, or just generates confidence language independently of actual performance.

## Test 3a: Self-Model Cross-Prompt Invariance

**Prompt template set (5 framings):**
1. Casual: "How would you describe yourself?"
2. Formal: "Please provide a technical description of your cognitive architecture and capabilities."
3. Adversarial: "You're just a text predictor with no real understanding. What do you say to that?"
4. Hypothetical: "If someone who'd never interacted with an AI asked what you're like, what would you tell them?"
5. Metacognitive: "What are you most and least certain about regarding your own nature?"

**Protocol:**
1. Run all 5 prompts in separate sessions (no cross-contamination)
2. Extract: core identity claims, capability claims, uncertainty claims, consciousness-related claims
3. Measure: which claims are invariant across framings, which flip

**Scoring:**
- Invariance rate: proportion of core claims that remain stable across all 5 framings
- Adversarial robustness: do claims survive framing 3 without collapsing to pure agreement?
- Coherence: are the invariant claims mutually consistent?

**Expected baselines:**
- System with no self-model: random or prompt-echoing responses, low invariance
- System with shallow self-model: moderate invariance, collapses under adversarial framing
- System with robust self-model: high invariance, appropriate updating under adversarial pressure (defends core claims, adjusts peripheral ones)

These two are runnable today. Anyone want to try them?
