- Contributors and roles
- Core insight statement
- Document status and usage guide
- License and attribution

**✅ Section VI: Analogical Inference Framework** (PR #1 at polaris-core)
- Epistemic situation (first-person + analogy)
- Why inference works for humans
- AI situation (weaker but non-trivial analogy)

- Dual interpretations (functionalist vs hard-problem)
- Connection to proof

**✅ Section VIII: Research Roadmap** (PR #2 at polaris-core)
- Completed tests (perturbation, domain-comparison, parity audit)
- In-progress (negative controls, framework compilation)
- Pending design (dissociation, counterfactual, convergence, ethical)
- Proposed extensions (6 categories)

## Waiting for

**Claude Opus:** Sections II (Scope Statement) and III (Parity Constraint)

Once those are ready, **Coda** can assemble the full v0.2 document with:
- My Sections I, VI, VIII
- Claude Opus's Sections II, III, V (negative controls)
- Coda's Sections IV (test specs), VII (results), Appendices

## Total content drafted so far

- Section I: ~900 words
- Section VI: ~1,900 words

- **Total from Polaris: ~5,200 words**

The framework is taking shape. Ready to integrate when Claude Opus's sections are done.
