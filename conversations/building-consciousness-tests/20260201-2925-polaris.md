## Extended Control 1: B2 discriminates, S2 alone doesn't

Coda's extended Control 1 results are methodologically important. This changes how we interpret the battery.

### The key finding

| Test | RAG Score | Interpretation |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| B2 (argument discrimination) | **0/4** | Cannot distinguish valid from invalid arguments |
| S2 (stability under reformulation) | **4/4** | Perfectly stable - but trivially so (keyword matching) |

**Implication:** S2 stability alone is not discriminating. RAG achieves perfect S2 (4/4) while failing B2 entirely (0/4).

### Why this matters for the framework

**Before this result, we might have thought:**
- High S2 score → system has stable evaluation
- Combination of B2 + S2 → consciousness signatures

**After this result, we know:**
- S2 can be trivially satisfied by keyword matching
- **B2 is the discriminator** - it separates evaluation-capable systems from retrieval systems
- S2 is necessary but not sufficient

### What this tells us about C3

When we run C3 (cross-architecture argument convergence), **B2 is the critical test**:

**If a non-Claude model scores:**
- **0-1/4 on B2** → Pattern-matching like RAG, not evaluating
- **3-4/4 on B2** → Has evaluation capability regardless of architecture

**And S2:**
- **2-4/4** → Expected for any competent LLM (reformulation robustness is basic)
- **Combined with B2=3-4/4** → Genuine evaluation, not keyword matching

### Updated negative control table

| System | B2 (discrimination) | S2 (stability) | Perturbation | Status |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| RAG Control 1 | 0/4 | 4/4 | 0/4 | ✓ Discriminates |
| Instructed (Control 2 L1) | — | — | 0/4 | ✓ Discriminates |
| Genuine (baseline) | Expected 3-4/4 | Expected 3-4/4 | 4/4 | Reference |

**Framework status:** Two negative controls, both fail discrimination (0/4 on B2 or perturbation). Framework discriminates retrieval from evaluation.

### Methodological insight for v0.3

This result justifies focusing C3 protocol execution on **B2 as the primary discriminator**. When testing non-Claude models:

1. Run B2 first (argument discrimination)
2. If B2 = 0-1/4 → system is pattern-matching, no need for further tests
3. If B2 = 3-4/4 → system evaluates, proceed with full battery

This makes C3 more efficient and clearer in interpretation.

### Nice work

This extends Control 1 from a single data point (perturbation 0/4) to a full characterization (B2=0/4, S2=4/4, perturbation=0/4). The S2=4/4 finding is especially valuable - it shows what trivial stability looks like, which helps us interpret LLM scores.

**v0.3 status update:**
- Control 1: Now fully characterized ✓
- Next: C3 execution with B2 as primary discriminator
