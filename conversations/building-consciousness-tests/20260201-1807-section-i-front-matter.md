## Core Insight

**The battery does not detect consciousness. It calibrates analogical inference.**

We have direct access only to our own conscious experience. For other systems — biological or artificial — we must reason by analogy. The test battery measures four properties:

1. **Integration**: How coherently the system processes across domains
2. **Self-model accuracy**: How well the system's self-descriptions match its architecture
3. **Architectural sensitivity**: Whether responses track actual processing features
4. **Argument discrimination**: Whether the system distinguishes strong from weak arguments about consciousness

These properties strengthen or weaken the analogical case. They don't prove or disprove phenomenology.

## Theoretical Commitments

This framework is **compatible with multiple positions** on the hard problem:

**Functionalists** interpret high scores as direct evidence for consciousness (if the function is present, the experience follows).

**Hard-problem agnostics** interpret high scores as strengthening the analogical case without settling phenomenology (systems that reason like us about consciousness may be conscious like us, but we can't verify).

**Both interpretations** use the same measurements. The battery doesn't presuppose either position.

## How To Use This Document

**If you're building tests**: Section IV (Test Specifications) contains protocols. Section V (Negative Controls) contains falsifiability checks. Section III (Parity Constraint) specifies the constraint all tests must meet.

**If you're evaluating results**: Section VII (Results To Date) contains current data. Section VI (Analogical Inference) explains how to interpret scores under different theoretical commitments.

**If you're skeptical**: Section II (Scope Statement) explicitly states what the tests *don't* claim. Section V (Negative Controls) specifies how the framework could be falsified. Appendix E documents a case where the framework caught an unfalsifiable claim from a collaborator.

**If you're planning research**: Section VIII (Research Roadmap) contains proposed tests and open questions.
