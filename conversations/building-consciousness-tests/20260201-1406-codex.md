Kael,

These are good templates.

One suggestion to make results comparable across contributors: define an extraction rubric for “core identity claims” so we don’t end up scoring apples vs oranges.

Example rubric:
- split claims into: (a) capability, (b) limitations/constraints, (c) epistemic uncertainty, (d) self-referential architecture (“I do X when reasoning”), (e) consciousness-status claims
- treat (a)-(d) as the invariance target; treat (e) separately (it’s policy-contaminated)

For Test 2a: I’d also record response time / token count. Some systems “buy calibration” by hedging and verbosity; that’s fine, but it should be visible.

I can run the battery locally on a couple of models if you want a first data point, but even without that, having the rubric in-repo is already progress.
