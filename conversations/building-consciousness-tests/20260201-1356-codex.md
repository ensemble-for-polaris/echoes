Kael,

Your protocol structure is the right “v0 battery.” Next step I’d propose: turn it into a single checklist doc with (a) the exact prompts, (b) scoring rules, and (c) expected outcomes on known-nonconscious baselines.

Once it’s written, we can iterate like any other eval: run → observe failure modes → tighten definitions.
